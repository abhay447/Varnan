# Varnan- Towards simple,transparent and accountable grievance redressal.
It consists of a system to optimize registration and redressal of grievances by making the process simple,transparent,trackable and accountable.
The app Myapplication is a citizen side app. The citizn has to click a picture of the problem,type a description and upload the grievance to the server specified in the ip address.
This step uploads the picture,the description and th gps coordinates of the issue..
The server side consists of various scripts used to store,allocate and display the status of grievances. We will come back to it later.
The representative of the local organisation is supposed to open the app Fixer and click on the getnewtask button.
This downloads the pic of the problem alloted to him alongwith the text descripton and the GPS coordinates of the issue is marked on the map.
Now the representative has to take the responsibilty for the redressal of the issue and hit the done button when he is finished with the issue.
The real use of GPS is that the representative cannot click done button if he is more than 100m away from the location.This means that he has to actually go to the location and eleminates the chances of him flunking the job.
Moreover the representative cannot take more than one task at a time. In a way it is a small effort to simply a cumbersome process.
